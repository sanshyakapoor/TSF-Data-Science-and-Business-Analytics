This repository has been made as a part of my Data Science and Business Analytics Internship with The Sparks Foundation

**Task #1- Prediction using Supervised ML**

-Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours

-This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

-You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

-What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

-Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data

**Task #2- Prediction using Unsupervised ML**

-From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

-Use R or Python or perform this task

**Task 3- Exploratory Data Analysis- Sports**

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’

● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors
contributing win or loss of a team.

● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b

● Advanced Level - Create storyboards. Screen-record along with your audio
explaining the charts and interpretations. Use annotations, animation and
images.

**TAsk 4- Color-Identification-In-Images**

Domain Category: Computer Vision and IOT

Objective : Implement an image color detector which identifies all the colors in an image or video.

**Task 5- Object Detection / Optical Character Recognition (ORC)**


● Implement an object detector which identifies the classes of the objects in
an image or video. OR
● Character detector which extracts printed or handwritten text from an
image or video.
● Below resources are just for references you can use any library/approach
to achieve the goal.
