Task #1- Prediction using Supervised ML

-Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours

-This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

-You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

-What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Task #2- Prediction using Unsupervised ML

-From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

-Use R or Python or perform this task

Task #3- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

-For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

-The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
